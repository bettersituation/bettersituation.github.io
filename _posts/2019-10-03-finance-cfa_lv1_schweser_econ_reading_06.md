**1. terms**  

(1) Exchange rate: the price of unites of one currency to another currency  
(2) In the quotation 1.25 USD/EUR, EUR is the **base currency** and USD is the **price currency**  
(3) price currency / base currency is sometimes referred to as a **direct quote** and base currency / price currency is referred to as a **indirect quote**  
(4) The price currency to base currency is **nominal exchange rate**  
(5) **Real exchange rate** considers price indices, so __Real exchange rate = nominal exchange rate \* (CPI_base / CPI_price)__  
(6) **Spot exchange rate** is a currency exchange rate for immediate delivery  
(7) **Forward exchange rate** is a currency exchange rate for an exchange in the future

**2. Foreign exchange market**  

(1) When a fire takes a position in the foreign exchange market to reduce an existing risk, we say the firm is **hedging** its risk  
(2) Alternatively, when a transaction increases risk, it is said **speculative** transaction or position  
(3) the primary dealers in currencies and originators of forward foreign exchange(FX) contracts are **large multinational banks**  
(4) This participants is often called **sell side**  
(5) buy side consists of as following  
-- Corporations  
-- Investment accounts  
-- -- Real money accounts refer to mutual funds, pension funds and others that do not use derivatives  
-- -- Leveraged accounts refer to the various types of investment firms that use derivatives  
-- Government and government entities, including sovereign wealth funds and pension funds  
-- retail market

**3. Interpret exchange rate change**  

(1) Consider a USD/EUR exchange rate that has changed from 1.42 to 1.39  
(2) Then **EUR is deprecated to 1.39/1.42 - 1 = -2.11%**  
(3) **USD is appreciated to (1/1.39)/(1/1.42) - 1 = 2.16%**  

<br>

**4. Interpret currency cross-rates**  

(1) corss rates is the exchange rate between two currencies implied by a common third currency  
(2) For example, **MXN/AUD = MXN/USD \* USD/AUD**  

<br>

**5. Expression of forward exchange rate**  

(1) **Points**: difference between forward exchange rate and spot exchange rate, forward - spot with 4th decimal number as 1 point  
(2) **Percent**: percent relative to spot exchange rate, forward/spot - 1  
(3) **discount or premium** is calculated relative to the spot exchange rate as a **percent**  

<br>

**6. Aribtrage and no arbitrage condition**  

(1) If the forward exchange rate does not correctly reflect the difference between interest rates of two countries, arbitrage transaction could generate a profit  
(2) **Arbitrage condition**  

$$
\frac{forward}{spot} = \frac{1 + i_{price}}{1 + i_{base}} \\
\; \\
\text{or equivalentely, } \\
\; \\
spot \cdot (1 + i_{price}) = forward \cdot (1 + i_{base})
$$

**7. Exchange rate regimes**  

(1) Countries that **do not have their own currency**  
-- **formal dollarization**: use the currency of another country, cannot have its own moentary policy  
-- **monetary union**: several countries use a common currency, countries participate in determining monetary policy, **like euro zone and ECB**  

(2) Countries that **have their own currency**  
-- **currency board arrangement**: explict commitment to fix exchange rate to a specified foreign currency, like Hong Kong,  
-- -- while the monetary authority gives up the ability to conduct independent monetary policy and imports the inflation rate of the outside currency  

-- **conventional fixed arrangement**: pegs its currency within margins of &plusmn;1% versus a basket of currencies  
-- -- direct intervention: monetary authority can maintain exchange rates with the band by purchasing or selling in the foreign exchange market  
-- -- indirenct intervention: change in interest rates, regulation of foreign exchange transactions and etc,.

-- **target zone**: pegging with more wide band &plusmn;2%  

-- **crawling peg**: the exchange rate is adjusted periodically  
-- -- passive peg: adjust for higher inflation versus the currency used in the peg, this is typical target zone type  
-- -- active peg: a series of exchange rate adjustments over time is announced and implemented, which can influence inflation expectations  

-- **management of exchange rates within crawling bands**: the width of the bands is increased over time. This is a method can be used to transition from a fixed peg to a floating rate  

-- **managed floating exchange rates**: attempts to influence the exchange rate in response to specific indicators such as balance of payments, inflation rates  

-- **independently floating**: the exchange rates is market determined, and foreign exchange market intervention is used only to slow rate of change and reduce short-term fluctations

**8. The effects of exchange rates on trade and capital flows**  

(1) **X - M &equiv; (S - I) + (T - G)**  
-- If trade deficit (X - M < 0), the total saving (S + T) is less than domestic investment in physical capital (I + G)  

(2) **Elastic approach** focuses on the exports and imports  
(3) **Absorption approach** focuses on capital flows  

<br>

**9. Elastic Approach**  

(1) The condition under which a depreciation of the domestic currency will decrease a trade deficit is **Marshall-Lerner condition**  

$$
W_X \epsilon_X + W_M (\epsilon_M -1) > 0 \\
\text{where} \\
W_X = \; \text{portion of total trade that is exports} \\
W_M = \; \text{portion of total trade that is imports} \\  
\epsilon_X = \; \text{price elasticity of demand for exports} \\
\epsilon_M = \; \text{price elasticity of demand for imports}
$$

(2) elasticity of demand is greater for goods with close subtitutes, goods that represent a high proportion of consumer spending, and luxury goods  
(3) Goods that are necessities, have few or no subtitutes, or represent a small portion of expenditures tend to have less elastic demand has low elasticity  

<br>

**10. J curve**  

(1) Import and export contracts for goods most often require delivery and payment in the future, import and export relatively insensitive to currency depreciation in the short run  
(2) This means that a currency depreciation may worsen a trade deficit initially  
(3) **This short term increase in trade deficit followed by a decrease when Marshall-Lerner condition is met** is referred to as the J curve  

<br>

**11. Absorption Approach**  

(1) Shortcoming of elastic approach is that it only considers trade balances, it ignores capital flow  
(2) The absorption approach is a macroeconomic technique that focuses on the capital account is that  

$$
BT = Y - E \\
\text{where} \\
Y = \; \text{domestic production of goods and services, or national income} \\  
E = \; \text{domestic absorption of goods and services, which is total expenditure} \\
BT = \; \text{balance of trade}
$$


(3) income relative to expenditure must increase for the balance of trade to improve, domesic saving must increase relative to domestic investment in physical capital(which is a component of E)  
(4) **When an economy is operating at less than full employment**, the currency depreciation makes domestic goods and assets more attractive, then as a result, goods and assets will increase both expenditures and income  
(5) **When tn economy is at full capacity**, an increase in domestic spending increase prices, which offsets the effects of depreciation
