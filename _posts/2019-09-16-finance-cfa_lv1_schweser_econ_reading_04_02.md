<h4>Monetary policy</h4>
<br>

**1. Monetary policy tools**  

(1) **Policy rate**, the rate at which banks can borrow reserves from the ___Fed is termed discount rate___, and ___ECB is termed refinancing rate___  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- One way to lend money to banks is through a **repurchase agreement**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- **The percentage difference between the purchase price and the the repurchase price is effectively the rate** at which the central bank is lending to member banks  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Its policy rate is called  the 2-week repo (repurchase) rate  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- In the United States, ___the fedral funds rate___ is the rate that banks charge each other on overnight loans of reserves  
(2) **Reserve requirements**  
(3) **Open market operations**  

<br>

**2. Monetary transmission mechanism**  

(1) Banks' short-term lending rates will increase in line with the increase in the policy rate, and vice versa  
(2) Bond, equity, asset prices will decrease as the discount rates increases, and **wealth effect** occurs because a decrease in households' asset may increase the saving rate and decrease consumption  
(3) Both consumers and businesses may decrease their expenditure because their expectations for future economic growth decrease  
(4) The increase in interest rates may attract foreign investment in debt securities, leading to an appreciation of the domestic currency relative to foreign currencies, which can reduce export goods.

**3. Central bank's essential qualities**  

(1) **Independence**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- **operational independence** means that central bank is allowed to independently determine the policy rate  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- **target independence** means central bank sets target inflation  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- **independence is relative terms (degree of independence)** rather than absolute terms  
(2) **Credibility**  
(3) **Transparancy**, which means central banks periodically disclose the state of the economic environment by issuing **inflation reports**  

<br>

**4. Expansionary Monetary Policy Effect**  

(1) In short run, changes in monetary policy can affect real economic growth as well as interest rates, inflation, and foreign exchange rates  
(2) The central bank buys securities, which increases bank reserves  
(3) The inter-bank lending rate decreases as banks are more willing to lend  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Market rates decrease duto to bank adjusting their lending rates  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Asset price increases due to lower discount rates  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Firms and individuals raise ther expectations for economic growth  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- The currency depreciates due to an outflow of foreign money  
(4) Other short-term rates decreases  
(5) Longer-term interest rates also decrease  
(6) The decrease in real interest rates cause the currency to depreciate  
(7) Lower interest rates cause consumers to increase their purchases  
(8) Depreciation of the currency increases foreign demand for domestic goods  
(9) These increase consumption, investment, and exports all increases aggregate demand  
(10) The increase in aggregate demand increase inflation, employment and real GDP  

<br>

**5. Targeting Process**  

(1) In the past, some have used interest rate  
(2) Currently, **inflation targeting** is the most widely used tool for making monetary policy decisions  
(3) The most common inflation target rate is 2% within &plusmn; 1%  
(4) Central banks are not necessarily targeting current inflation, but target inflation in the range of 2 years in the future  
(5) Some countries, especially developing countries use exchange rate targeting, called pegging  
(6) Pegging arises volatile and uncertain economic situation  
(7) Pegging has limits on how much influence currency purchases or sales can have on exchange rates

**6. Whether a Monetary policy is expansionary or contractionary ?**  

(1) **real trend rate** refers to an economy's long-term sustainable real growth rate  
(2) **neutral interest rate = real trend rate + inflation target**  
(3) When the policy rate is above the neutral interest rate, it is contractionary and vice versa  

<br>

**7. Limitations of Monetary Policies**  

(1) If individuals and firms believe that a decrease in the money supply intended to reduce inflation will be successful, they will expect lower future inflation rates,  
Because long-term bond yields include a premium for expected inflation, long-term rates could fall, even while the central bank has increased short-term rates in order to slow economic activity  
(2) Monetary tightening can be viewed too extreme, increasing probability of recession, making long-term bonds more attractive and reducing long-term interest rates  
(3) **Liquidity trap**, where demand for money very elastic, willingly hold more money evenv without a decrease in short-run rates  
(4) Increasing money may not increase economic activity, for example in 2008, first expansionary policy affects small, then QE(Quantitive Easing) is conducted
