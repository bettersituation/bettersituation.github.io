<h4>The firm and market structures: Oligopoly</h4>
<br>

**1. Properties**  

(1) Few firms  
(2) Firms are inter-dependent  
(3) products can be differentiated or equal  
(4) High barriers to entry  

<br>

**2. Collusive agreements**  
(1) Collusive agreements makes firms to have more benefit by regulating competitions  
(2) However there may be laws to prohibit collusive agreements.  
(3) An example of Collusive agreements(or _cartel_) is OPEC, their members cheat others regularly.  
(4) Collusive agreements to increase price will be more successful  
- when  
- a. fewer firms  
- b. products are more similar  
- c. cost structures are more similar  
- d. purchases are relatively small and frequent  
- e. retaliation for cheating is more severe  
- f. less competition outside the cartel

**3-I Explanation of oligopoly with _Kinked demand curve model_**  

(1) Based on the assumption that __the increase in a firm's product price will not be followed by it's competitors,  
but a decrease in price will be followed__  
(2) If a firm raises its price, competitors remain previous price  
(3) If a firm decreases its price, competitors react

**3-II Explanation of oligopoly with _Cournot model followed by Nash equilibrium model_**  

(1) Cournot model considers a duopoly (i.e., oligopoly with only two competitors)  
(2) Each firm ___knows the quantity the other fims supply___  
(3) Decisions of two firms are determined ___simultaneously___  
(4) ___Nash equilibrium___ is that there is no other choice that makes any firm better  
(5) ___Nash equilibrium___ may not bset for any firm  

_(Example: prisoner's dillema)_  

|   |B is silent|B confesses|
|---|---|---|
|A is silent|A, B: 6 months|A: 10 years, B: free|
|A confesses|A: free, B: 10 years|___A, B: 2 years___ <br> _(Nash equilibrium)_|  

<br>

**3-III Explanation of oligopoly with _Dominant firm model_**  

(1) Market price is essentially determined by the dominant firm  
(2) Non-dominant firms takes this market price as given  
(3) Non-dominant firm's quantity decreases as price decreases (so, gap narrows as price decreases)

**4. Price boundary of oligopoly**  

- Price is determined between price that maximizing net total revenue  
and price that are equal to that of perfect competition, in other words, marginal cost.
