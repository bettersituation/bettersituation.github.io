<h4>Aggregate Econimics: IS, LM, AD, AS</h4>
<br>

**1. Preliminaries**  

(1) Consumption is a function of disposable income  
(2) ___MPC(Marginal propensity to consume)___ refers to the proportion of additional income spent on consumption  
(3) ___MPS(Marginal propensity to save)___ refers to the proportion of additional income spent on saving  
(4) MPC + MPS = 100%  
(5) Investment is a function of expected  profitability and the cost of financing  
(6) financing costs are reflected in ___real interest rate___, approximated by ___nominal interest rate - expected inflation rate___  
(7) ___fiscal balance(G - T)___ is clearly a function of output  
(8) ___Net exports___ are a function of domestic disposable incomes, foreign disposable incomes, and relative prices of goods in foreign and domestic markets  
(9) GDP = C + I + G + (X - M) = C(Y-T(Y)) + I(r) + G + NX(Y)  
(10) S = I + fiscal balance(G - T) + trade balance(X - M)

**2. IS curve (invesetment saving curve)**  

(1) Locus of points where ___equilibrium between demand and supply in real(non-financial) market___ achieved  
(2) Each point refers aggregated invested or saved moeny
(3) Downward sloping

**3. LM curve (liquidity money curve)**  

(1) Locus of points where ___equilibrium between liquidity preference(demand) and supply(determined by (central) banks) in financial market___ achieved  
(2) Each point refers liquid moeny  
(3) Upward sloping  
(4) Assume M/P is fixed

**4. LM curves for different money supply and simultaneous equilibrium**  

(1) higher M/P(money supply / price index) results in more liquidity, and vice versa  
(2) Simultaneous equilibrium of IS and LM means equilibrium of real market and money market

**5. Deriving AD (aggregate demand) curve**  

(1) At each level of M/P, equilibrium point of real market and money market moves  
(2) Then let's ___assume M is constant P is a variable___  
(3) AD curve is a lotus of points where equilibrium of real market and money market achieved as assuming M is fixed and P is a variable

**6. AS (aggregate supply) curve**  

(1) It represents the amount of output that firms will produce at different price levels  
(2) ___LRAS___: Long run aggregate supply  
(3) ___SRAS___: Short run aggregate supply  
(4) ___VSRAS___: Very short run aggregate supply  
(5) ___Potential GDP___ or ___full-employment GDP___ refers to the level of output at LRAS

**7. Factors to move AD curve**  

(1) GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
(2) Increase(decrease) in consumers' wealth (affecting C)  
(3) Business expectations (affecting I)  
(4) Consumer expectations of future incode (affecting C)  
(5) High capacity utilization (affecting I)  
(6) Expansionary monetary policy (affecting C, I)  
(7) Expansionary fiscal policy (affecting G, C)  
(8) Exchange rates (affecting X)(# devaluation of country's currency derives increase in export and decrease in import)  
(9) Global economic growth (affecting X)

**8. Factors to move SRAS curve**  

(1) Labor productivity  
(2) Input prices(ex. raw material's price)  
(3) Expectations of future output prices  
(4) Taxes and government subsidies  
(5) Exchange rates

**9. Factors to move LRAS curve**  

(1) Increase(decrease) in supply and quality of labor  
(2) Increase(decrease) in supply of natural resources  
(3) Increase(decrease) in the stock of physical capital  
(4) Technology
