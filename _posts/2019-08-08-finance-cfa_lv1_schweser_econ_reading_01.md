<h4>Demand and Supply</h4>
<br>

**Own-price elasticity**  

$$
:= \frac{dQ/Q}{dP/P} \\
we \; say \; elastic \; if \; |e| \ge 1 \\
inelastic \; if \; |e| \le 1 \\
perfectly \; elastic \; if \; |e| = \infty \\
perfectly \; inelastic \; if \; |e| = 0 \\
unitary \; or \; unit \; elastic \; if \; e = 1
$$

<br>

**Factor affecting own price elasticity**  

(1) portion of income spent on a good: larger portion in accordance with more elasticity  
(2) time: longer time in accordance with more elasticity  

<br>

**Property of own price elasticity**  

(1) elasticities of downward linear demand curve are various because elasticity uses portion of change, not value of change.  
(2) maximum profit is achieved at the unit elasticity.  

<br>

**Income elasticity of demand**  

$$
:= \frac{dQ/Q}{dI/I} \; (I: income)
$$

<br>

**Categories according to income elasticity**  

(1) __normal goods__: goods with positive income elasticity  
(2) __inferior goods__: goods with negative income elasticity  

<br>

**Cross price elasticity of demand**  

$$
:= \frac{dQ_{own}/Q_{own}}{dP_{other}/P_{other}}
$$

<br>

**Categories according to cross price elasticity**  

(1) two goods are __complements__ if corss price elasticity is negative  
(2) two goods are __substitutes__ if corss price elasticity is positive  

<br>

**Additional categories of goods**  

(1) __Giffen goods__: inferior goods s.t. negative income effects outweights positive substitution effect  
(2) __Veblen goods__: higher price maskes more desirable  

<br>

**Factors of production**  

(1) Land  
(2) Labor  
(3) Capital  
(4) Materials  

We often consider capital and labor only for economic analysis.  
f: (Captical x Labor) &rightarrow; Quantity is so called __production function__  

<br>

**Marginal of production function**  

(1) Assume capital is fixed. Marginal productivity increases first, then decreses, and total productivity decreses to the extreme degree  


<br>

**Shutdown and Breakeven**  

(1) if total return &le; total variable cost, it would be better to shutdown in the short run.  
(2) if total return &le; total cost, it would be better to breakeven in the long run.  

<br>

**Economics and diseconomics of scale**  

(1) as scaling, economics of scale is achieved to some extent  
(2) beyond that, diseconomics of scale occurs  
(3) __minimum efficient scale__ means efficient scale at which minimum total cost is achievied
