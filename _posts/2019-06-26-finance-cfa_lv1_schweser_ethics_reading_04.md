<h4>GIPS(Global Investment Performance Standards)</h4>
<br>

**Past misleadings**  
1. Representative accounts: showing a top-performing portfolio as representative of a firm's results  
2. Survivorship bias: excluding bad performance accounts  
3. Varying time periods: showing performance for selected time periods  


```
GIPS are a set of ethcial principles based on standardized, industry-wide approach.  
Investment firms voluntarily follow GIPS.  
GIPS allow clients to more easily compare investment performance.
```  


**Composite**  
1. A grouping of individual discretionary portfolios representing similar investment strategy, objective, or mandate.  
2. A composite must include all fee-paying discretionary portfolios.  


**Required verification**  
1. Verification is performed by a third party  
2. A third party verifier must  attest  **(1) complied with all GIPS requirements for composite construction**,  
**(2) procedures and processes are in accordance with the calculation methodology, data, format required by GIPS.**  


**Recommended verification**  
1. Verification applies to the entire firm's performance mesurement practices and methods, not a selected composite.  
2. Verified firms should include the following disclosure words.  
"[verified firm] has been verified for the periods [dates] by [verifier]. A copy of the verification report is available upon request."
