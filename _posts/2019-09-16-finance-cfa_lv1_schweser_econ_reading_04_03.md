<h4>Fiscal policy</h4>
<br>

**1. Roles and Objective of Fiscal Policy**  

(1) Keynesian economists believe that fiscal policy can have a strong effect on economic growth when economy is operating at less than full employment  
(2) Monetarists believe that the effect of fiscal policy is temporary  
(3) Monetarists believe that monetary policy cannot influence aggregate demand to counter cyclical movements in the economy  
(4) **Discretionary fiscal policy** refers to the spending and taxing decisions  
(5) **Automatic stabilizers** are built-in fiscal devices triggered by the state of the economy, for example unemployment insurance payments  
(6) Objective may include **influencing the level of economic activity**  
(7) Objective may include **redistributing wealth**  
(8) Objective may include **allocating resources among economic agents**  

<br>

**2. Spending tools**  

(1) **Transfer payments** like unemployment insurance benefits  
(2) **Current spending**:  government purchases of goods and services on an ongoing and routine basis  
(3) **Capital spending**: government spending on infrastructure  

<br>

**2-1. Justification of Spending tools**  

(1) Provide services like national defense that benefit all the residents  
(2) Invest in infrastructure to enhance economic growth  
(3) Support the country's growth and unemployment target  
(4) Provide minimum standard of living  
(5) Subsidize investment in research and development for certain high-risk ventures like green technology  

<br>

**3. Revenue tools**  

(1) **Direct taxes** are levied on income or wealth  
(2) **Indirect taxes** are levied on goods and services, such as VATs, which can be used to reduce consumption of some goods like tobacco  

<br>

**3-1. Desirable attributes of tax policy**  

(1) Simple to use and enforce  
(2) Efficiency, having the least interference with market  
(3) Fairness  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Horizontal equality: people in similar situations should pay similarly  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Vertical equality: richer people should pay more in taxes  
(4) Sufficiency, generating sufficient revenues  

<br>

**4-1. Advantage of fiscal policy tools**  

(1) Social policies, such as discouraging tobacco use can be implemented quickly via indirect taxes  
(2) Quick implementation means government revenues can be increased without additional cost  

<br>

**4-2. Disadvantage of fiscal policy tools**  

(1) Direct taxes and transfer payments take time to implement  
(2) Capital spending takes a long time to implement  

<br>

**4-3. Properties of fiscal policies**  

(1) Announcing a change may have significant effects  
(2) Spending tools are most effectivein increasing aggregate demand  
(3) Tax reductions less effective  

<br>

**5. Fiscal Multiplier**  

(1) **Multiplier effect** depends on the tax rate and on the marginal porpensity to consume  
(2) **Disposable income** is income after taxes  
(3) **fiscal multiplier = 1 / (1 - MPC(1-t))**  

<br>

**6. Balanced Budget Multiplier**  

(1) Assume increase taxes by \$100 and MPC = 80% and tax rate = 25%  
(2) The initial decrease in spending from a tax increase is **\$80 = \$100 x MPC**  
(3) The composite decrease in spending = **\$80 x fiscal multiplier = \$80 x 2.5 = \$200**  
(4) The composite increase in aggregate demand derive from government spending of \$100 is \$250  
(5) Net aggregate increase is \$250 - \$200 = \$50  
(6) **If government increase taxes \$125 = \$100/MPC and spend \$100, then net effect of aggregate demand remains zero**  

<br>

**7. Ricardian Equivalence**  

(1) Increase in current deficit means increase taxes in the future  
(2) taxpayers increases current savings in order to offset the expected cost  
(3) **So net effect of aggregate demand is zero**  
(4) vice versa  

<br>

**8. Fiscal deficits and GDP**  

(1) **A country's debt ratio = fiscal deficit / GDP**  
(2) Arguments for being concerned with the size of fiscal deficit:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Higher deficits lead to higher future taxes, higher taxes discourage working, which leads to lower long-term economic growth  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- investors may not refinance the debt, which leads to the government default, and printing money ultimately lead higher inflation  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- increased government debt will tend to increase interest rates, and firms reduce borrowing and investing, which decrease the effect on aggregate of deficit borrowing  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- this phenomenon is referred to as the **crowding-out effect**  
(3) Arguments for not being concerned:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- If the debt held by domestic citizens, the problem is overstated  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- If the debt is used to finance productive capital investment, future economic gains will be sufficient to repay the debt  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Fiscal deficits may prompt needed tax reform  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Deficits would not matter because of Ricardian Equivalence, which offsets future defict  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- If the economy is in non-full capaciy, deficits can aid in GDP and employment  

<br>

**9. Implementation and Difficulties of fiscal policy**  

(1) Discretionary fiscal policy is expansionary when the economy is below full employment  
(2) During inflationary economic booms, actions can be taken to decrease government spending or increase taxes  
(3) **Recognition lag**: the lagging time policy makers recognize the economic problems  
(4) **Action lag**: the lagging time governments discuss, vote, and enact  
(5) **Impact lag**: the lagging time fiscal policies rise the impact on the economy  
(6) **Misreading economic statistics**, for example, the full employment level is not precisely measurable  
(7) **Crowding-out effect** hinder fiscal policies  
(8) In case of **supply shortage**, expansionary fiscal policy will fail  
(9) **Limits to deficits** hinder in case of already too high deficits situation  
(10) In case of **Multiple targets**, for example, in the situation of unemployment and high inflation, fiscal policy cannot address both problems simultaneously  

<br>

**10. Wheter a fiscal policy is expansionary or contractionary ?**

(1) If surplus increases or deficit decreases, this is indicative of a contractionary fiscal policy  
(2) If surplus decreases or deficit increases, this is indicative of a expansionary fiscal policy  
(3) Economists often use **structural(or cyclically adjusted) budget deficit** to gauge fiscal policy, this is the deficit that would occur based on current policies if the economy were at full employment  

<br>

**11. Interaction of monetary and fiscal policies**  

(1) **Both Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies**: aggregate demand &uarr; interest rates &darr;, both private and public sector &uarr;  
(2) **Expansionary fiscal, contractionary monetary policies**: aggregate demand &uarr; (fiscal policy), interest rates &uarr; (increased fiscal borrowing and monetary policy), public sector to GDP &uarr;  
(3) **Contractionary fiscal, expansionary monetary policies**: interest rates &darr; (decreased fiscal borrowing and monetary policy), increasing both private consumption and output, public sector to GDP &darr;  
(4) **Both Contractionary fiscal and monetary policies**: aggregate demand &darr; interest rates &uarr;, both private and public sector &darr;
