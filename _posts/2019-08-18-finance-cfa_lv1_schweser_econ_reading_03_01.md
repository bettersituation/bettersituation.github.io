<h4>Aggregate Econimics: GDP</h4>
<br>

**1-1. GDP**  

(1) total market value of the goods and services produced in a country with in a certain time period  
(2) The sale or resale of goods produced in previous periods is excluded  
(3) Transfer payments by the government(ex. unemployment, retirement, and welfare benefits) are not included  
(4) can be calculated respect to ___expenditure approach___ or ___income approach___  
(5) expenditure approach: ___value of final output method___ or ___sum of value added method___  

<br>

**1-2. types of GDP**  

- ___Nominal GDP___: sum of (price of good_i in year_t * quantity of good_i in year_t)  
- ___Real GDP___: sum of (price of good_i in base year) * quantity of good_i in year_t)  
- ___GDP deflator___: Nominal GDP / Real GDP  
- ___Per-capita real GDP___: real GDP / population (often used as a measure of the economic well-being of a country's residents)

**1-3. formulars relative to GDP**  

$$
\text{(1) In expenditure approach, } \\
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M) \\
\text{where} \\
\text{C: consumption spending} \\
\text{I: Investment} \\
\text{G: government purchases} \\
\text{X: exports} \\
\text{M: imports}
$$


$$
\text{(2) In income approach, } \\
GDP = national \; income + CCA(capital \; consumption \; allowance) + statistical \; discrepancy \\
\text{where} \\
\text{CCA measures of the depreciation of physical capital from the production of goods and services over a period} \\
\text{statistical discrepancy is an adjustment for the difference between income approach GDP and expenditure approach GDP} \\
\text{ } \\

(3) national \; income = compensation \; of \; employees(wages \; and \; benefits) \\
+ corporate \; and \; government \; enterprise \; profits \; before \; taxes \\
+ interest \; income \\
+ unicorporated \; business \; net \; income(business \; owners' \; incomes) \\
+ rent \\
+ indirect \; business \; taxes - subsidies(taxes\; and \; subsidies \; that \; are \; included \; in \; final \; prices)
$$


$$
\text{(4) Personal income is a measure of the pretax income received by households, one determinant of consumer purchasing power and consumption} \\
\text{differs from national income in that personal income includes all income households received, including transfer payments} \\
personal \; income = national \; income \\
+ transfer \; payments \; to \; households \\
- indirect \; business \; taxes \\
- corporate \; income \; taxes \\
- undistributed \; corporate \; profits
$$


$$
\text{(5) PDI(Personal disposable income) is personal income after taxes} \\
\text{PDI measures the amount that households have available to either save or spend and indicator of the ability of consumers} \\
PDI = personal \; income - personal \; taxes
$$

<br>

**1-4. relationship of GDP factors**  

$$
\text{Respect to expenditure approach, } \\
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M) \\
\text{On the otherhand, respect to income approach, } \\
GDP = C + S + T \\
\text{where} \\
\text{C: consumption spending} \\
\text{S: households and business savings} \\
\text{T: net taxes(= taxes paid - transfer payments received)} \\
\text{ } \\
Thus, \; C + I + G + (X - M) = C + S + T \\
\rightarrow S = I + (G - T) + (X - M) \\
\text{where} \\
\text{G - T is the fiscal balance} \\
\text{X - M is the trade balance}
$$
