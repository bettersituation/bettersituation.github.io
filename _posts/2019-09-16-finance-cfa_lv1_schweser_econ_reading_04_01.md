<h4>Money and Inflation</h4>
<br>

**1. Fiscal and Monetary Policy**  

(1) **Fiscal policy** refers to a government's action that affect economic activity  
(2) **Budget is balanced** when tax revenues equal government expenditure  
(3) **Budget surplus** occurs when tax revenues is greater than government expenditure  
(4) **Budget deficit** occurs when tax revenues is less than government expenditure  
(5) **Monetary policy** refers to the central banks's action that affect the quantity of moeny  
(6) **Monetary policy is expansionary(or accomodative or easy)** when central bank increases the qunatity of money  
(7) **Monetary policy is contractionary(or restrictive or tight)** when central bank decreases the quantity of money

**2. Functions of money**  

(1) medium of exchange(or means of payment)  
(2) unit of account  
(3) store of value  

<br>

**3. Types of Money**  

(1) **Narrow money** = the amount of notes and coins + balances in checkable bank deposits  
(2) **Broad money** = narrow money + liquid assets  
(3) Measure of money differs, but **generally broad money contains less liquid moeny**

**4. Money Creation Process**  

(1) In the early stages of moeny developed, **promissory notes** were backed by gold  
(2) From that, **fractional reserve banking** designed  
(3) **Excess reserves** is the amount left after meeting fractional reserve banking  
(4) **Money multiplier = 1 / reserve requirement**  

<br>

**5. Qunatity theory of money, Quantity equation of exchange**  

(1) MV = PY (money supply * velocity = price level * real output)  
(2) **Velocity** is the average number times per year each unit of money is used to buy goods or services  
(3) **Monetarists** believe that velocity and real output change slowly, so increase in the quantity of money affects increase in price level  
(4) This argue is called **Money neutrality**  

<br>

**6. Types of demand for money**  

(1) Transaction demand  
(2) Precautionary demand: held for unforeseen future needs  
(3) Sepculative demand  

<br>

**7. Supply and Demand for money**  

![](/assets/img/finance_cfa_econ_reading_04_01/figure1.png)

(1) Short-term interest rates are determined by the equilibrium between money supply and demand  
(2) An increase in the money supply will put downward pressure on interest rates  
(3) Supply of money is determined by the central bank  

<br>

**8. Fisher effect**  

$$
R_{nom} = R_{real} + E[I] \; \text{where E[I] is expected inflation}\\
\; \\
\text{for investors perspective,}\\
R_{nom} = R_{real} + E[I] + RP \; \text{where RP is risk primium for uncertatiny}
$$

**9. Roles of central banks**  

(1) Sole supplier of currency  
(2) Banker to the government and other banks  
(3) Regulator and supervisor of payment system  
(4) Lender of last resort  
(5) Holder of gold and foreign exchange reserves  
(6) Conductor of monetary policy  

<br>

**10. Problems and Objective of a central bank**  

(1) Primary objective is to **control inflation**  
(2) **High inflation** leads to menu costs(cost to businesses of changing their prices)  
(3) **High inflation** leads to shoe leather costs(cost to individuals  of making frequent trips)  
(4) **Stability in exchange** rates with foreign currencies  
(5) **Full employment**  
(6) **Sustainable positive economic growth**  
(7) **Moderate long-term interest rates**  
(8) The target inflation rate in most developed countries **range around 2% to 3%**  
(9) A target of zero inflation is not used because that **increases the risk of deflation**  
(10) While most developed countries have an explicit target inflation rate, **U.S. Fed and BOJ does not have**  
(11) Because Fed U.S. has additional goals of **maximum employment** and **moderate long-term interest rates**  
(12) Because Japan experienced long deflation  
(13) Some developed and several developing countries, choose ad target level for the exchange rate of their curreny with that of another country, primarily the U.S. dollar  
(14) This is referred to as **pegging**  
(15) **Pegging leads volatility of their money and interest rate**  

<br>

**11. Costs of expected and unexpected inflation**  

(1) One effect of high inflation(even when perfectly anticipated) is that the cost of holding money rather than interest-bearing  securities is higher because its purchasing power decreases steadily  
(2) Costs imposed on an economy by unanticipated inflation,  
(3) When inflation is higher than expected, borrowers gain at the expenses of lenders as loan payments in the future  
(4) When inflation is lower than expected, this benefits lenders  
(5) In an economy with volatile inflation rates, lenders will require higher interest rates to compensate for the additional risk  
(6) Another cost of unexpected inflation is that information about supply and demand, this results in un-stable production and lay-off
