(2) Benefit 2: Increase in employment and wages to exporting countries  
(3) Cost: Domestic industries producing importing goods

<br>

**4. Comparitive advantage and absolute advantage**  

(1) Absolute advantage  
(2) Comparitive advantage  
(3) Opportunity cost  
(4) Production Possibility Frontier: curve describing combinations of goods at full employment  

<br>

**5. Ricardian model and Heckscher-Ohlin model**  

(1) **Ricardian model of trade has one factor - labor**, the differences in production costs is the differences in labor productivity due to differences in technology  
(2) **Heckscher-Ohlin model has two factors - capital and labor**, the source of comparative advantage is differences in the relative amounts of each factor  
(3) In the Heckscher-Ohlin model, there is a redistribution of wealth within each country between labor and the owners of capital  
(4) The good that a country exports will rise in price  
(5) The good that a country imports will fall in price  

<br>

**6. Reasons to trade restrictions**  

(1) Infant industry: giving an opportunity to grow  
(2) National security  
(3) Protecting domestic jobs

(1) Tariffs: taxes on imported goods  
(2) Quotas: limits on the amount of imports  
(3) Export subsidies: government payments to firms that export goods  
(4) Minimum domestic content: Requirement that some percentage of product content must be from the domestic country  
(5) Voluntary export restraint: in the hope of avoiding tariffs or quotas  

<br>  

**8. Economic implication of trade restrictions**  

- (1) Tariffs/quotas

-- In the case of a quota, if the domestic government collects the full value of the import licenses, the result is the same as for a tariff  
-- This amount is a gain to those foreign exporters who receive the import licenses under the quota and the are termed quota rents  
- &nbsp;
- (2) voluntary export restraint(VER) result in welfare loss  
- (3) Export subsidies  
- &nbsp;
- Most of the effects of all four of these protectionist policies are  
- (1) reduce imports  
- (2) increase price  
- (3) decrease consumer surplus  
- (4) increase domestic quantity supplied  
- (5) increase producer surplus  

<br>

**9. Capital restrictions**  

(1) capital restrictions on the flow of financial capital  
(2) overall, capital restrictions are thought to decrease economic welfare  
(3) Trading blocs

<br>

**10. trading blocs**  

- the positive effects result from increased trade according to comparative advantage, as well as increased competition among firms  
- negative effects result because some firms and group of workers will see their wealth and income decrease  
- &nbsp;  
- **trading blocs or RTA(regional trading agreements**  
- (1) Free trade area: all barriers to import and export of goods and services among member countries are removed  
- (2) Customs union: Free trade area + all countries adopt a common set of trade restrictions with non-members  
- (3) Common market: Customs union + all barriers to the movement of labor and capital goods among member countries are removed  
- (4) Economic union: Common market + member countries establish common institutions and economic policy  
- (5) Monetary  union: Economic union + member countries adopt a single currency  
- NAFTA is an example of a free trade area  
- EU is an example of an economic union  
- euro zone is an example of an monetary union  

<br>

**11. Objectives of capital restrictions**  

(1) Reduce the volatility of domestic asset prices, especially in recession  
(2) Maintain fixed exchange rates  
(3) Keep domestic interest rates low  
(4) Protect strategic industries  

<br>

**12. Balance of payments accounts**  

(1) According to the U.S. Fedral Reserve, BOP(balalnce of payments) includes the **current account**, **capital account**, **financial account**  
(2) **Current account**  
-- Mercahndise and services  
-- income receipts(foreign income from dividends and interests on debt)

- (6) A country that has exports more than imports is said to have a current account (trade) surplus  

<br>

**13. Relation between trade deficit and others**  

**X - M = private savings + government savigns - investment**  

<br>

**14. International organizations**
