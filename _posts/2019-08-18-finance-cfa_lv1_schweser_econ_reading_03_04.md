<h4>Aggregate Econimics: Economic growth</h4>
<br>

**1. Sources of economic growth**  

(1) Labor supply  
(2) Human capital  
(3) Physical capital stock  
(4) Technology  
(5) Natural resources  

<br>

**2. Sustainability of economic growth**  

(1) Sustainable rate of economic growth is important  
(2) potential GDP = aggregate hours worked x labor productivity  
(3) growth in potential GDP(%) (or sustainable growth rate) = growth in labor force(%) + growth in labor productivity(%)  

<br>

**3. Production function**  

(1) production function: Y = A x f(L, K) (A: total factor productivity, L: size of labor force, K: amount of capital available)  
(2) per worker production function: Y/L = A x F(K/L)  
(3) ___Dimnishing marginal productivity___ assumed for K/L (capital per worker)  
(4) Sustainable long-term growth cannot necessarily be achieved simply by capital depending investment  

<br>

**4. Solow model or neoclassical model**  

(1) growth in potential GDP = growth in technology + W_L*growth in labor + W_C*growth in capical  
(2) growth in per-capita potential GDP = growth in technology + W_C*growth in the capital-to-labor ratio
